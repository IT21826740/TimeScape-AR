# 🕒 TimeScape AR

**TimeScape AR** is an immersive Augmented Reality experience that brings together creatures from different timelines—prehistoric dinosaurs and mythical beasts—in one interactive scene. Built using **A-Frame** and **AR.js**, this web-based AR application lets users explore animated 3D models like the **Diabolus Rex**, **Stegosaurus**, **Velociraptor**, and **Dragon** using marker-based tracking.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a WebAR-compatible browser (Chrome recommended).
3. Use a printed or digital **Hiro marker** to view the models in AR.

> You can print a Hiro marker from [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/pattern-files/pattern-hiro.png)

## 🗺️ Scenario

> In *TimeScape AR*, a tear in the space-time continuum has brought together dinosaurs and mythical creatures in a single distorted timeline. With the balance of nature disrupted, these creatures—once rulers of their own worlds—must now adapt, coexist, or clash in unfamiliar territory. You, the explorer, get a rare window into this chaotic fusion of history and legend.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* 🌿 Add environmental background (jungle, volcano, ruins)
* 🎮 Include interactive controls (click to animate/sound)
* 📱 Deploy on mobile via GitHub Pages or Netlify
* 🧠 Add storytelling voiceover or text narration
